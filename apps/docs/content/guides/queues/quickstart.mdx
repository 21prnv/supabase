This guide is an introduction to interacting with Supabase Queues via the Dashboard. Check out [Queues SQL API Reference](/docs/guides/queues/pgmq) for more details on the SQL API.

## Concepts

Supabase Queues is a pull-based Message Queue consisting of three main components: Queues, Messages, and Queue Types.

### Pull-Based Queue

A pull-based Queue is a Message storage and delivery system where consumers actively fetch Messages when they're ready to process them - similar to constantly refreshing a webpage to display the latest updates. Our pull-based Queues process Messages in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner without priority levels.

### Message

A Message in a Queue is a json object that is stored until a consumer explicitly processes and removes it, like a task waiting in a to-do list until someone checks and completes it.

### Queue types

Supabase Queues offers three types of Queues:

- **Basic Queue**: A durable Queue that stores Messages in a logged table.
- **Unlogged Queue**: A transient Queue that stores Messages in an unlogged table for better performance but may result in loss of Queue Messages.

- **Partitioned Queue** (_Coming Soon_): A durable and scalable Queue that stores Messages in multiple table partitions for better performance.

## Create Queues

To get started, navigate to the [Supabase Queues](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/queues/overview) Postgres Module under Integrations in the Dashboard and enable the `pgmq` extension.

<Admonition type="note">

`pgmq` extension is available in Postgres version 15.6.1.143 or later.

</Admonition>

  }}
/>

On the [Queues page](/dashboard/project/_/integrations/queues/queues):

- Click **Add a new queue** button

<Admonition type="note">

If you've already created a Queue click the **Create a queue** button instead.

</Admonition>

- Name your queue

<Admonition type="note">

Queue names can only be lowercase and hyphens and underscores are permitted.

</Admonition>

- Select your [Queue Type](#queue-types)

### What happens when you create a queue?

Every new Queue creates two tables in the `pgmq` schema. These tables are `pgmq.q_<queue_name>` to store and process active messages and `pgmq.a_<queue_name>` to store any archived messages.

A "Basic Queue" will create `pgmq.q_<queue_name>` and `pgmq.a_<queue_name>` tables as logged tables.

However, an "Unlogged Queue" will create `pgmq.q_<queue_name>` as an unlogged table for better performance while sacrificing durability. The `pgmq.a_<queue_name>` table will still be created as a logged table so your archived messages remain safe and secure.

### Enable RLS on your tables in `pgmq` schema

For security purposes, you may want to enable Row Level Security (RLS) on Queue tables (all tables in `pgmq` schema that begin with `q_`).
